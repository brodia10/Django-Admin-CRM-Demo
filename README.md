# Django Admin CRM

Django Admin CRM is a customer relationship management and team collaboration app that integrates nicely with Django admin.

## Components

There are 4 main components to this app:

### Customer management
### Candidate management
### Bulk emailing
### File sharing

These are all accessed directly through the django admin and can be expanded upon in your project.

## Notes

### Formatting

This project follows the `black` formatting and `flake8` linting standards.

### Recommendations

We recommend using the Django admin theme library `django-jazzmin` with Django Admin CRM as they compliment each other well.
